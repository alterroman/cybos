| Dimension | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Geography | 8/15 | Tel Aviv, Israel — Eastern EU/Israel bracket |
| Size | 10/15 | ~15-30 employees — lower edge |
| Funding | 11/15 | Seed $7M |
| Rust depth | 25/25 | 93.6% Rust, 368 releases, v3.191.0 Feb 26 2026 — extremely active Rust development |
| Domain | 13/15 | Developer tools (Kubernetes dev tooling) |
| Outsource | 8/15 | Fast-growing with complex agent protocol work; need to expand Rust capacity beyond core team |
| **Total** | **75/100** | |

**Why Serokell should reach out**: Israeli Rust devtools startup releasing Rust code literally every day (368 releases, latest Feb 26 2026) — new language runtime support, enterprise features, and agent protocol work are natural engagement areas; geography is a mild penalty but Israel is comfortable with EU/remote engineering partnerships.

- **LinkedIn**: https://www.linkedin.com/company/tensorzero
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/tensorzero

**Score breakdown**:
| Dimension | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Geography | 15/15 | New York, NY — US |
| Size | 10/15 | ~10-20 employees — below sweet spot lower bound |
| Funding | 11/15 | Seed $7.3M |

| Domain | 10/15 | AI/ML infrastructure |
| Outsource | 5/15 | Hiring signal; small team; no explicit outsourcing/remote-first signal found |
| **Total** | **76/100** | |

**Why Serokell should reach out**: The team has a former Rust compiler maintainer — this sets a very high technical bar and means Serokell must lead with deep Rust expertise (not just capacity); the pitch should focus on specialized inference backend work or observability pipeline optimization where Serokell's systems depth exceeds generalist shops.

## Watch List (Score 50-64)

### 64/100 — Spice AI

- **Website**: https://spiceai.org
- **HQ**: Seattle, WA (US)
- **Score**: 64
- **Why borderline**: US Series A ($13.5M), Rust-primary codebase (SQL query engine + LLM runtime in Rust, 5,225 commits), but very small team (~10-25 employees, below sweet spot). Domain is AI/ML infra (strong) but company may be too early-stage for a $100k engagement. Decision maker: Philip LeBlanc (CTO), Luke Kim (CEO).
- **Watch for**: Series B raise or team growth past 25 employees; if they grow headcount, re-qualify.

---

### 62/100 — Flashbots

- **Website**: https://flashbots.net
- **HQ**: Remote / US leadership
- **Score**: 62
- **Why borderline**: Strong Rust signal (rbuilder, mev-inspect-rs in Rust), blockchain/MEV domain is 15/15 fit, remote team is outsourcing-friendly, well-funded via MEV protocol revenue. Penalized because: funding structure is non-standard (protocol revenue, not VC Series A/B), and team size is difficult to verify. Main Rust repo (rbuilder) has only 526 stars — smaller footprint than other candidates. Decision maker: Robert Miller (CEO), Phil Daian (co-founder).
- **Watch for**: If they pursue institutional VC funding or grow engineering headcount significantly; also watch for formal rbuilder expansion.

---

### 60/100 — Golem Cloud

- **Website**: https://golem.cloud
- **HQ**: Remote / EU-based team
- **Score**: 60
- **Why borderline**: Rust-first Wasm distributed platform (83.9% Rust, 31 contributors, 5,291 commits, active Jan 2026), EU-adjacent team, good domain fit (systems infra). Penalized because: funding is very limited ($3-5M estimated, limited public info), team size is very small, and engineering leadership is unclear (no confirmed CTO name found). Decision maker: unknown (engineering lead TBD per finder notes).
- **Watch for**: Funding announcement (if they raise Series A, re-qualify immediately); confirm engineering leadership.

---

### 58/100 — Embark Studios

- **Website**: https://embark.dev
- **HQ**: Stockholm, Sweden (EU)
- **Score**: 58
- **Why borderline**: Serious Rust commitment (rust-gpu 7.6k stars, kajiya 5.3k, cargo-deny 2.2k), EU HQ, large team (~100-200). Penalized because: fully funded subsidiary of Nexon (gaming company) — not Series A/B startup with outsourcing budget pressure; they have significant internal resources. Outsourcing motivation is low for a well-funded game studio.
- **Watch for**: If Embark spins off any Rust infrastructure products or signals contractor openness; monitor rust-gpu commercialization.

---

### 55/100 — Elodin Systems

- **Website**: https://elodin.systems
- **HQ**: San Francisco, CA (US)
- **Score**: 55
- **Why borderline**: Fascinating Rust aerospace startup (91.2% Rust, YC + Lux Capital $6M seed, 20 contributors, v0.16.1 Feb 18 2026), safety-critical domain where formal methods matter. Penalized because: very small team (~10-25), only 508 GitHub stars suggests early product stage, and aerospace domain may have regulatory/clearance constraints that complicate external contracting. Serokell has limited aerospace domain track record.
- **Watch for**: If they grow past 25 employees or raise Series A; any public signals of Rust capacity need.

### 52/100 — RisingWave Labs

- **Website**: https://risingwave.com
- **HQ**: San Francisco, CA (US) + Singapore
- **Score**: 52
- **Why borderline**: Series B $75M, Rust-primary streaming database (99%+ Rust, 8,820 stars), good domain fit (systems infra). Significantly penalized because: ~100-200 employees with Series B and Singapore-heavy engineering team suggests they have substantial internal Rust capacity; outsourcing readiness is low for a well-staffed company; dual HQ (US + Singapore) complicates timezone and contracting.
- **Watch for**: If they need specialized Rust expertise (e.g., formal verification of consensus protocols) that their team lacks.
