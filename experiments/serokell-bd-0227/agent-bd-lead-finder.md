- **Coverage gaps**:
  - Could not access Wellfound, LinkedIn, Greenhouse, Ashby, Indeed job boards (403 errors) — job board mining would likely surface 10-20 additional candidates
  - Could not access Crunchbase, PitchBook for precise funding validation — some funding figures are estimated from press releases found in README files
  - Perplexity and Exa could not be accessed directly; used GitHub API as primary discovery mechanism
  - Did not fully cover: automotive/ADAS Rust companies, medical device Rust companies (APAC-heavy), fintech trading firms using Rust without public GitHub repos
  - APAC-HQ companies (Juspay, Parseable, Sigma Prime) flagged but included as they have US/EU market focus
  - Some very early-stage companies (pre-seed) were found but excluded per ICP criteria

COMPLETED: bd-lead-finder found 40 candidate companies
