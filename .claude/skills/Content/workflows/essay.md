# Essay Workflow

Write long-form English content for Twitter articles, LinkedIn, standalone publications.

---

## Required Context

**Load before drafting:**
1. `context/style/voice-identity.md` - Persona, tone, anti-patterns
2. `context/style/writing-style-en.md` - English style rules, essay structure

---

## Workflow

### 1. ASSESS

Check if topic requires research:
- **Data claims?** → Verify with quick search before writing
- **Opinion/analysis?** → Skip to drafting

If sources provided (@file references):
- Read all source files
- Extract key ideas, arguments, data
- Use as foundation, not final content

### 2. DRAFT

Choose mode based on source and audience:

**Narrative Mode** (general audience):
- Hook → Stakes → Mechanism → Turn (optional) → Landing
- Smooth flow, one clear thread

**Analytical Mode** (VCs, founders, engineers, research-based):
- Show reasoning before conclusions
- Preserve source's technical nuance
- Keep genuine questions as genuine
- Open questions section optional
- No invented metaphors unless they add analytical value

Default to analytical when source material is research.

**Length:**
- Short: 500-800 words (single idea)
- Standard: 800-1500 words (thesis + arguments)
- Deep: 1500-2500 words (complex topic)

Don't pad. If the idea is complete, stop.

### 3. REVIEW

Present draft to user:

```
