# Serokell Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

Serokell is a software development company specializing in Rust, Haskell, and functional programming.
They deliver high-quality engineering for technically demanding projects.

## Engagement Model

- **Team size**: 2-4 engineers
- **Duration**: 3-6 months (typical), 1+ year (long-term accounts)
- **Budget**: $80k-$200k per engagement
- **Sweet spot**: ~$100k / 3-4 months / 3 engineers
- **Geography**: US and EU (timezone compatibility, legal comfort with outsourcing)

## Ideal Company Profile

### Size
- **Sweet spot**: 20-200 employees
- **Why**: Big enough to have budget, too small to have a full Rust team in-house
- **Acceptable**: Up to 500 if technically driven and lean eng team

### Funding Stage
- **Best**: Series A or Series B (growth pressure + capital available)
- **Acceptable**: Well-funded Seed ($3M+), Series C+ if the team is lean
- **Red flag**: Bootstrapped (budget constrained), pre-seed (too early)

### Tech Stack Signals
Strong signals (high score):
- Active Rust codebase on GitHub
- Job postings mentioning Rust (even if not hiring externally)
- Blog posts or tech talks about Rust migration
- WebAssembly (Wasm), embedded systems, blockchain nodes

Weak signals (still relevant):
- C++ codebase looking to modernize
- Go/Python stack with performance bottlenecks
- Fintech requiring memory-safe systems

### Domain Fit (Serokell's strongest verticals)
1. **Blockchain / Web3** - node development, protocol engineering, smart contract infra
2. **Systems infrastructure** - databases, storage, networking, runtime systems
3. **Fintech** - high-performance trading, risk engines, payment processing
4. **Embedded / IoT** - firmware, real-time systems, safety-critical software
5. **Developer tools** - compilers, CLIs, language runtimes, build systems
6. **AI/ML infrastructure** - inference engines, data pipelines, MLOps tools

### Outsourcing Readiness Signals
- Has worked with contractors or agencies before (job posts mention "vendors")
- Distributed or remote-first culture
- Engineering blog or GitHub shows external contributors
- Product/engineering leadership at VP or CTO level (decision maker accessible)
- Fast-growing team (needs to ship faster than they can hire)

## Disqualifiers

- **No Rust relevance**: pure mobile, front-end only, no systems component
- **Regulated/closed**: defense contractors, classified systems
- **Too small**: fewer than 15 employees (unlikely to afford $100k engagement)
- **Wrong geography**: APAC, LATAM (timezone + legal friction)
- **No technical leadership**: purely sales-driven company unlikely to value quality engineering

## How Serokell Wins Deals

1. Technical credibility — deep Rust/Haskell expertise, open source contributions
2. Speed — can staff a team of 3 in 2-4 weeks
3. Quality — formal methods, code review, documentation standards
4. Communication — async-first, strong English, EU/US timezone overlap
