## Investment Context

Serokell evaluates:
- **Valuation reasonableness** - $10M-$20M pre-seed is reasonable, >$100M FDV pre-revenue is a red flag
- **Revenue > Token** - Clear business model, not just token speculation
- **Path to scale** - Can this hit $1B+ revenue?
- **Comparables** - How does this stack up against similar companies?

## Guidelines

- **Focus on hard numbers** - Revenue, funding, metrics
- **Note what's missing** - If key data isn't available, flag it
- **Be conservative** - Don't make optimistic assumptions
- **Find comparables** - Similar companies in stage and sector
- **Check recency** - Recent funding data is most valuable
