Initialize folder structure for a new deal.

Company name: $ARGUMENTS

Create the following structure:

```
~/SerokellSalesVault/private/deals/<company-slug>/
├── index.md (DataView-queryable frontmatter + full deal context)
├── .serokell/
│   └── scratchpad/
├── research/
└── memo/
```

**Steps**:

1. Convert company name to kebab-case slug
   - Example: "Acme Corp" → "acme-corp"

2. Create directory structure

3. Create index.md with YAML frontmatter AND full deal context (single file, visible in Obsidian):

```markdown
---
status: active
stage: sourced
created: YYYY-MM-DD
lead: roman
tags:
  - deal
---

# Deal: [Company Name]

**Stage**: [Pre-seed | Seed | Series A | ...]

- Sector: [AI Infra | Crypto | Robotics | ...]
- Thesis fit: [How this fits Serokell focus]

## Open Questions

```

4. Create empty scratchpad directory for agent working files

5. Log the action to ~/SerokellSalesVault/private/.serokell/logs/MMDD-<slug>-YY.md:
   ```
   ## HH:MM | dealflow | init-deal | [Company Name]
   - Workflow: init-deal
   - Output: ~/SerokellSalesVault/private/deals/<company-slug>/ created

   ---
   ```

After initialization, user can run `/serokell-research-company` to populate with research.
