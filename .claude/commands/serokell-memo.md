   - Provide executive summary and investment thesis
   - Identify risks and recommend next steps
   - Make clear recommendation (INVEST/PASS/MORE DILIGENCE)

3. **WRITE**: Use memo-writer agent (Sonnet) to fill template

   - Include scoring sheet, financial analysis, exit scenarios
   - Prepare IC Q&A and document sources

4. **REVIEW**: Verify completeness
