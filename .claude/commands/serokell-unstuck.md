# Unstuck

Interactive focus/clarity ritual for breaking distraction loops and reconnecting with goals.

## Usage

```
/serokell-unstuck
```

## What It Does

Opens a web interface that guides you through a reflective process:

1. **PAUSE** - Name what's happening (scattered, avoiding, overwhelmed, etc.)
2. **FORK** - Did naming it help? If not, dig deeper
3. **DIG DEEPER** (if needed) - Prompts from therapy/coaching:
   - What am I protecting myself from?
   - Where do I feel this in my body?
   - What would I do if this feeling wasn't in the way?
4. **CONNECT** - Shows your Active Priorities, pick what feels alive
5. **CAPTURE** - Brief note for pattern tracking
6. **RELEASE** - You're clear. Go.
